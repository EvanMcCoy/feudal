#NPC Profiles are sections that define the attributes of purchasable NPCS.  NPCs can be purchased for a defined cost
#then deployed to guard the player's kingdom or attack the land of others.
#WARNING: Removing any profile that players have purchased as part of an NPC with in-game currency will be deleted from the
#player's army without refund.  If you have a valid replacement or just wanted to change the name, open the kingdom and fief files
#and manually change the npc listings in the army sections to the proper name.
